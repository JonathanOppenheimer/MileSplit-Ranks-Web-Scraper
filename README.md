If you've ever run XC or Track at a non-professional level, your results were probably posted to [MileSplit](https://www.milesplit.com/), "the premier network for track & field and cross country." Essentially, they host all the results of various races and meets throughout the United States and publish them in a navigable format with specific meet results, results by athlete, results by event, and so on available.
